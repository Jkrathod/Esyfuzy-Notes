What is vapt ? , Port numbers , tools , Linux version, commands etc,

VAPT stands for Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing. It involves identifying vulnerabilities in a system and testing them.

    Vulnerability Assessment involves identifying vulnerabilities in a system through various tools and techniques.

    Penetration Testing involves simulating an attack on the system to identify vulnerabilities and test the security measures in place.

    Some common tools used for VAPT include Nmap, Nessus, Metasploit, and Wireshark.

    Port numbers are used to identify specific services running on a system. Some common port numbers include 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS, and 22 for SSH.

Types of attack, how you defend live attack


There are various types of attacks such as phishing, malware, DDoS, etc. Defending live attacks requires a multi-layered approach.

    Types of attacks include phishing, malware, DDoS, SQL injection, etc.

    Defending live attacks requires a multi-layered approach including firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, anti-virus software, etc.

    Regularly updating software and educating employees on security best practices can also help prevent attacks.

    In the event of a live attack, quick response and incident management is crucial to minimize damage and prevent further spread of the attack.

    Examples of live attacks include the WannaCry ransomware attack, the Equifax data breach, and the Mirai botnet DDoS attack
