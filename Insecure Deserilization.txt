Insecure Deserilization 

Serilization is when data structure or object states are translated into a format that can be stord 
Deserilization is the opposite process it involves extracting a data structure from a series of bytes 
 
This vulnerability potentially enables an attacker to manipulate serilized object in order to pass harmful data into the application 



mitigation : 

Execute strict constraints for the deserialization processes before object creation

safe desirilization lib 

input validation

input sanitization

check for modifications in serialized data
