### CSRF

Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) is a type of attack that tricks a victim into submitting a malicious request to a website that they 
are authenticated to. The malicious request can be used to perform actions on the victim's behalf, such as transferring funds, 
changing account settings, or making unauthorized purchases.
