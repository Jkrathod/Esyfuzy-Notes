"Every ending is a new beginning, and sometimes the happiest endings are the ones we least expect."

Reflecting on an incredible journey at Clue4 Evidence Forensic Lab that has shaped my professional growth and taught me invaluable personal & professional lessons. I am very much grateful to Director Sir Phaneendar BN for the opportunities, and would like to express my gratitude for amazing work environment and colleagues, and impactful events I had the privilege to be a part of.
Sir (Phaneendar BN ) your mentorship has truly made a difference in my life and I am grateful for all the opportunities and guidance to learn from you.

I started as a TRAINEE after my Bachelor's in Forensic Science; aimed to learn and get an industrial exposure. As Clue4 Evidence Forensic Lab has a policy to provide bigger opportunities to their interns/trainees; I started working as a JR SCIENTIFIC ASSOCIATE. In my journey I got the chance to be part of amazingly tricky and exciting real-time cases, insightful National Conferences and workshops, and most importantly regular interaction with young minds from different backgrounds, project/dissertation interns. I would like to share with you all that CLUE4 EVIDENCE FOUNDATION has endless initiatives for FORENSICS, LAW and students from almost all Backgrounds. Don't miss the chance!

I feel fortunate to be a part of CLUE4 EVIDENCE team. Thankyou C4E!

Am very excited to carry these experiences forward as I embark on new adventures.
