SSTI

TPL map

SSTI stands for "Server-Side Template Injection.

It is a critical web application vulnerability that occurs when untrusted user input is directly 
or indirectly embedded in server-side templates without proper validation or sanitization. 
SSTI allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server-side.


Here's a simple explanation of SSTI:

Imagine you're creating a letter using a template where you can fill in placeholders like Dear {{name}}, 
and the template engine replaces {{name}} with the actual name when generating the letter. 
Now, let's say an attacker figures out a way to inject code instead of a name.

When the template engine processes the letter, it mistakenly executes the injected code. 
This could lead to the attacker gaining access to internal server data, manipulating the template's behavior, 
or even executing arbitrary commands on the server.

SSTI is a serious security concern because it can lead to full server compromise, data leaks, 
or the execution of harmful actions. Preventing SSTI involves properly validating and sanitizing user input, 
using context-aware encoding, and being cautious with template engines to ensure that only int
ended content is processed.
